<h3 id='taxa'>Classification</h3>
Phylum: Arthropoda<br>
Class: Mammalia<br>
Order: Chiroptera<br>
Family: Pteropodidae<br>
Genus: <i>Aethalops</i><br>
Species: <i>alecto</i><br>
<h3 id='desc'>Description</h3>
Forelimb length: 4.65&nbsp;cm<br>
Mass: 15&nbsp;g<br>
Coloration: brown or black fur
<h3 id='habitat'>Habitat</h3>
Native to: Southeast Asia; <i>i.e.</i>, Malaysia, Indonesia, et cetera<br>
Found in: forests on mountains, ostensibly not found at elevations lower than 1 km
<h3 id='feeding'>Feeding</h3>
<p>As the name implies, it is an herbivorous bat. It uses sight and smell to locate food, tearing fruit off trees with their teeth before flying to their roosts to actually eat. It also helps disperse seeds by doing this.</p>
<p>It has been posited that during light rainfall, they may straighten their hind legs, forming an upside-down "V" shape, and lick water as it reaches the head.</p>
<h3 id='digestion'>Digestion</h3>
<p>A. alecto  has a fairly comman digestive tract including an esophagus, stomach, et cetera. It has more enzymes that process sugar than insectivorous bats due to its diet.</p>
<h3 id='excretion'>Excretion</h3>
<p>Waste products are discharged as guano.</p>
<h3 id='respiration'>Respiration</h3>
<p>A. alecto  shares a system similar to other mammals, with lungs, a heart, hemoglobin (oxygen-carrying blood cells) and et cetera; any difference comes from a greater efficiency due to having evolved to fly. However, it still primarily possesses mammalian lungs, and thus cannot fly as efficiently as birds (since air must travel bidirectionally through them).</p>
<h3 id='circulation'>Circulation</h3>
<p>This works similarly to other mammals as well, with a heart to direct blood flow through arteries and arterioles, and capillaries, and back through venules and veins. Oxygen is, of course, exchanged in the lungs via a separate circuit.</p>
<h3 id='reproduction'>Reproduction</h3>
<p>Sperm is passed through a male's penis into a female's vagina. The breeding months are from February to June, and the gestation period is roughly 4-6 months, and generally only one bat is born per litter. The male does not do very much to assist in nurturing the offspring.</p>
<h3 id='trivia'>Trivia</h3>
<ul><li>Along with other fruit bats, pygmy fruit bats do not use echolocation, as insectivorous bats do.</li>
<li>Its species name, alecto, is the name of one of the Erinyes, or Furies, in Greek mythology, meaning "unceasing anger". (Interesting name for an herbivorous bat.)</li>
<li>It had controversially been considered the same species as the only other of the genus, A. aequalis  (which was recorded later), though the two are currently considered separate species.</li>

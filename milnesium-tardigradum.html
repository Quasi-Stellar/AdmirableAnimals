<h3 id='taxa'>Classification</h3>
Phylum: Tardigrada<br>
Class: Eutardigrada<br>
Order: Apochela<br>
Family: Milnesiidae<br>
Genus: <i>Milnesium</i><br>
Species: <i>tardigradum</i><br>
<h3 id='desc'>Description</h3>
Length: up to 0.7&nbsp;mm<br>
Has a symmetrical body in segments; it has eight legs and uses claws.
<h3 id='habitat'>Habitat</h3>
Native to: Europe, North America, Asia, Australia, and Antarctica<br>
Found in: moist environments; most commonly on mosses in temperate biomes. However, it is capable of surviving extremes, proven by its discovery in the Antarctic and at high altitudes (2.25 km above sea level).
<h3 id='feeding'>Feeding</h3>
<p>M. tardigradum  is omnivorous, feeding on amoeboids, algae, nematodes, and smaller tardigrades. It has limestone stylets—functionally similar to a tooth for piercing—on its mouth, which pierce prey for the tardigrade to consume the inside. Despite normally having a slow speed of 100 µm/s (0.1 mm/s), it is apparently able to "sprint" in bursts. </p>
<p>It has been posited that during light rainfall, they may straighten their hind legs, forming an upside-down "V" shape, and lick water as it reaches the head.</p>
<h3 id='digestion'>Digestion</h3>
<p>M. tardigradum 's digestive tract bears the parts that larger animals have, including a mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestine, and anus.</p>
<h3 id='excretion'>Excretion</h3>
<p>Presumably it defecates via the anus, since it's the end of the digestive tract.</p>
<h3 id='respiration'>Respiration</h3>
<p>M. tardigradum, like many other invertebrates, has a body cavity called a hemocoel. M. tardigradum 's contacts its entire body at once, and as the site of gas exchange, this cavity acts in lieu of a central respiratory system.</p>
<h3 id='circulation'>Circulation</h3>
<p>The hemocoel is responsible for blood circulation as well, having immediate access to the entire body.</p>
<h3 id='reproduction'>Reproduction</h3>
<p>Female M. tardigradum  can lay eggs and reproduce without fertilisation by sperm in a process known as parthogenesis (shared by many other freshwater invertebrates). Clutches seem to be anywhere from 1-12 eggs, averaging close to 7 eggs, each hatching within 1-2 weeks. M. tardigradum  is sexually mature by 8-12 days after birth.</p>
<h3 id='trivia'>Trivia</h3>
<ul><li>M. tardigradum  can survive in a cryptobiotic state; it pauses metabolic activities in such state, and resumes them afterwards. One such example is in the state of anhydrobiosis; when their environment dries up, they dry up with it, shriveling up into a smaller structure, a tun. They are able, however, to later resume normal metabolic activity.</li>
<li>In 2007, it became the first species recorded to survive exposure to open space, having survived 10 days of experiencing unfiltered UV radiation, enduring brutal cold (-270°&nbsp;C), and being in a vacuum. It remained capable of reproduction subsequently.</li>
<li>Though known for their resilience, tardigrades are not all so. Only terrestrial ones, like M. tardigradum, are so adaptive. Aquatic species have had no need to be so adaptive due to environmental conditions being much more stable.</li>

<h3 id='taxa'>Classification</h3>
Phylum: Chordata<br>
Class: Reptilia<br>
Order: Squamata<br>
Family: Agamidae<br>
Genus: <i>Pogona</i><br>
Species: <i>vitticeps</i><br>
<h3 id='desc'>Description</h3>
Length: up to 60&nbsp;cm (24&nbsp;in.)<br>
Coloration: varies depending on surroundings. It can be brown, red, yellow, white, or orange, among other shades, and can mildly change to adapt to temperature changes.
<h3 id='habitat'>Habitat</h3>
Native to: central Australia<br>
Found in: dry woodlands, rocky deserts
<h3 id='feeding'>Feeding</h3>
<p>They eat vegetation, small insects, and small vertebrates like smaller lizards. They "shoot" their tongue forward, to which the food will adhere, and draw back the prey or plant to be chewed before being swallowed.</p>
<p>It has been posited that during light rainfall, they may straighten their hind legs, forming an upside-down "V" shape, and lick water as it reaches the head.</p>
<h3 id='digestion'>Digestion</h3>
<p>Bearded dragons have a digestive tract including an esophagus, stomach, and intestine. Waste is discharged via the cloaca.</p>
<h3 id='excretion'>Excretion</h3>
<p>Waste exits through the cloaca.</p>
<h3 id='respiration'>Respiration</h3>
<p>Bearded dragons have lungs with similar core features as human lungs, such as the alveoli; however, the lung itself is smaller, and alveoli are found on attached portions. As with reptiles in general, their lungs are much less efficient than those of mammals (though being evidently sufficient).</p>
<p>Air is "pumped" through the body by creating a cavity, an area with low pressure into which air will flow. Body muscles expand or contract to control the cavity size. (When the cavity size decreases, the excess air is pumped out.)</p>
<h3 id='circulation'>Circulation</h3>
<p>Reptiles use a heart and an artery/vein network. Like in humans, it utilises double circulation (one system to arteries and veins, the other to the lungs.)</p>
<h3 id='reproduction'>Reproduction</h3>
<p>The bearded dragon has two hemipenes, only one of which is used at any given time for copulation. Sperm does not travel through a tube, but travel along a groove on the hemipenis from the cloaca.</p>
<h3 id='trivia'>Trivia</h3>
<ul><li>Due to its relatively simple maintenance (compared to other exotic animals), it is often kept as a pet.</li>
<li>The bearded dragon (really all of the species) can "inflate" the face and beard to appear larger and more intimidating.</li>
<li>Eggs that are incubated at a sufficiently high temperature—32° C (90° F) or higher—may transform genetically male bearded dragons into fertile females.</li>
</ul>

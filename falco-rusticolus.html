<h3 id='taxa'>Classification</h3>
Phylum: Chordata<br>
Class: Aves<br>
Order: Falconiformes<br>
Family: Falconidae<br>
Genus: <i>Falco</i><br>
Species: <i>rusticolus</i><br>
<h3 id='desc'>Description</h3>
Wingspan: 123&nbsp;cm (48.4&nbsp;in.)<br>
Coloration: varies from white to grey to brown, and is often spotted (speckled).
<h3 id='habitat'>Habitat</h3>
Native to: Arctic tundra<br>
Found on: cliffs, previous nests of other birds on said cliffs. It hunts over both land and sea.
<h3 id='feeding'>Feeding</h3>
<p>The gyrfalcon overlooks an area from a high perch or from the air. It may approach quietly at a low altitude or it may pursue the prey in flight. They eat birds and mammals, and may also hunt over water. When it catches its target, it uses its beak to partition the food into edible chunks.</p>
<h3 id='digestion'>Digestion</h3>
<p>Food is stored in a crop, an area in the esophagus, if the stomach (proventriculus) is full. It has two stomachs: the proventriculus acts how a human's stomach does, breaking down food; the ventriculus, more commonly known as the gizzard, is responsible for grinding larger pieces before sending them to the proventriculus. Wholly indigestible materials are regurgitade in pellets called casts.</p>
<h3 id='excretion'>Excretion</h3>
<p>Waste products, urine and feces, are discharged through the cloaca.</p>
<h3 id='respiration'>Respiration</h3>
<p>The gyrfalcon extracts oxygen from the air. It has several air sacs throughout the body rather than only a set of concentrated lungs as mammals have (it has a set of smaller lungs). The air is sent through tubes to the air sacs, then to the lungs after that. The air is recycled in this loop before being discharged.</p>
<h3 id='circulation'>Circulation</h3>
<p>The gyrfalcon has a circulatory system with a heart and blood vessels; its heart is significantly faster than that of humans. Relative to its size, its heart is also 50-100% larger than those of most reptiles and mammals.</p>
<h3 id='reproduction'>Reproduction</h3>
<p>Males perform aerial stunts. If the female submits, the pair mates for life, and they nest on a cliff, defending a territory with a radius of over a mile. Egg clutches are normally 1-5 eggs, with an incubation period of 34-36 days and a nestling (time from hatching to flying) period of 45-50 days.</p>
<h3 id='trivia'>Trivia</h3>
<ul><li>In terms of horizontal flight speed, the gyrfalcon is the fastest bird, being able to fly at 90 mph. (The peregrine falcon can famously reach 200 mph, but only in its dive; in horizontal speed, it only flies at around a maximum of 68 mph.)</li>
<li>The gyrfalcon is also the largest falcon, and was valued by royalty as a hunting bird.</li>
<li>Climate change has increased the habitat of peregrine falcons, allowing them to move north and pressure gyrfalcons. While gyrfalcons are larger, they are less aggressive than peregrines and are thus often harassed by peregrines.</li>

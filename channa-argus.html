<h3 id='taxa'>Classification</h3>
Phylum: Chordata<br>
Class: Actinopterygii<br>
Order: Perciformes<br>
Family: Channidae<br>
Genus: <i>Channa</i><br>
Species: <i>argus</i><br>
<h3 id='desc'>Description</h3>
Length: can be over 85&nbsp;cm<br>
Coloration: brown with blotches
<h3 id='habitat'>Habitat</h3>
Native to: China, Russia, Korea<br>
Introduced to: United States<br>
Found in: freshwater habitats with shallow depth (up to 2.5&nbsp;m normally) and preferably slow or still waters<br>
<h3 id='feeding'>Feeding</h3>
<p>The northern snakehead generally hunts in a school, eating primarily smaller fish. While it has teeth, these are generally used for holding the prey still; like many other carnivorous fish, it swallows its prey whole.</p>
<h3 id='digestion'>Digestion</h3>
<p>The northern snakehead has an esophagus, stomach, liver, intestine and anus. The food is digested in the stomach and leaves the stomach as a liquid.</p>
<h3 id='excretion'>Excretion</h3>
<p>Ammonia waste is discharged via the gills. The kidney is in charge of most other waste management. As a freshwater fish, the snakehead also loses salt to its environment via simple diffusion; it must have a regular salt intake to maintain the proper level.</p>
<h3 id='respiration'>Respiration</h3>
<p>The northern snakehead breathes air via a suprabranchial chamber in addition to using gills to exchange gases with the surrounding water (which contains dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide). The suprabranchial chamber allows them to gulp air and thus survive in low-oxygen environments.</p>
<h3 id='circulation'>Circulation</h3>
<p>Its circulatory system has similar parts to those of mammals, like the heart, arteries and veins, and capillaries. However, after blood is oxygenated at the gills, where gas exchange occurs, it does not flow to the heart before it flows to the rest of the body.</p>
<h3 id='reproduction'>Reproduction</h3>
<p>Males secrete sperm, in the form of a fluid called milt, through an opening behind the anus. The females release eggs via the ovaries through their corresponding opening.Females build floating nests from plants and deposit the eggs, which are then fertilised. Spawns can contain 1300-1500 eggs. Both parents guard the nest and hatched young for several weeks.</p>
<h3 id='trivia'>Trivia</h3>
<ul><li>Due to the ability to breathe air, northern snakehead can survive out of water for a few days; juveniles are capable of migrating short distances over land.</li>
<li>Northern snakehead is an invasive species in the United States and competes with native species for food. For instance, their diet is very similar to that of largemouth bass.</li>
<li>Despite being an invasive species in the US, it is valued as a pet in Europe and Japan.</li>

<h3 id='taxa'>Classification</h3>
Phylum: Chordata<br>
Class: Amphibia<br>
Order: Anura<br>
Family: Microhylidae<br>
Genus: <i>Paedophryne</i><br>
Species: <i>amauensis</i><br>
<h3 id='desc'>Description</h3>
Length: 7.7&nbsp;mm<br>
Coloration: mostly brown, with black spots that resemble generic landmass on a map.
<h3 id='habitat'>Habitat</h3>
Native to: Papua New Guinea<br>
Found in: leaf litter (the layer of dead leaves on the ground) in rain forests
<h3 id='feeding'>Feeding</h3>
<p>It is not wholly clear how it eats, due to its relatively recent discovery and large difficulty even finding and recording it. Since it likely eats small invertebrates like mites, it is not unlikely that it stays still and waits for prey to be close enough to just nab it.</p>
<h3 id='digestion'>Digestion</h3>
<p>P. amauensis  has an esophagus, stomach, instestines, and a cloaca. The tract ends through the anus. Food is broken down in the stomach as with most animals with a stomach.</p>
<h3 id='excretion'>Excretion</h3>
<p>Waste exits through the cloaca/anus.</p>
<h3 id='respiration'>Respiration</h3>
<p>Being a frog, P. amauensis  breathes via buccal pumping, in which it visibly inflates and deflates part of itself to provide air flow. A buccal cavity expands or contracts; expanding draws air in, while contracting pushes air out. While some of the air that is pushed out goes back into the atmosphere, a sufficient amount reaches the lungs. As an amphibian, its skin also allows for much diffusion of environmental molecules into its body, allowing it to respire in part via this diffusion as well.</p>
<h3 id='circulation'>Circulation</h3>
<p>P. amauensis  has three blood circuits: one is the regular circuit throughout the body, one is the regular circuit between the heart and lungs, and the third circuit carries  deoxygenated blood near the skin for diffusion of oxygen from the air into the blood.</p>
<h3 id='reproduction'>Reproduction</h3>
<p>The male and female concurrently deposit sex cells, so that the female does not actually carry fertilised eggs, but deposits them as they are fertilised. It is possible that the frogs create a small "nest" or other hiding place for breeding, which many frogs that mate terrestrially do. Eggs do not hatch into tadpoles; rather, the frogs are born already resembling the shape of the adults.</p>
<h3 id='trivia'>Trivia</h3>
<ul><li>P. amauensis  is considered the smallest known vertebrate as a species at 7.7 mm.</li>
<li>Parts of P. amauensis ' skeleton remain soft throughout adulthood, whereas corresponding parts in other frogs harden. This is probably how they are so small.</li>
<li>P. amauensis  has been observed jumping at least 30 times its length.</li>

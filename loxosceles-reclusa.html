<h3 id='taxa'>Classification</h3>
Phylum: Arthropoda<br>
Class: Arachnida<br>
Order: Araneae<br>
Family: Sicariidae<br>
Genus: <i>Loxosceles</i><br>
Species: <i>reclusa</i><br>
<h3 id='desc'>Description</h3>
Length: 0.5&nbsp;inches<br>
Coloration: brown<br>
It has a dorsal stripe that often resembles a violin, earning it the nickname "fiddleback spider"
<h3 id='habitat'>Habitat</h3>
Native to: mid-western and southern US<br>
Found in: dry woodlands, homes and other human buildings, and under rocks or bark; generally dry, secluded areas
<h3 id='feeding'>Feeding</h3>
<p>The brown recluse hunts nocturnally for insects, using its web only as an alert system for prey; it ambushes its prey thereafter. It will bite said prey, injecting fluids to “liquefy” the interior for digestion. </p>
<p>It has been posited that during light rainfall, they may straighten their hind legs, forming an upside-down "V" shape, and lick water as it reaches the head.</p>
<h3 id='digestion'>Digestion</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, they will inject fluids into the prey via bite, making the insides an easily ingested liquid. In this sense, the food is digested outside of the spider itself.</p>
<h3 id='excretion'>Excretion</h3>
<p>Waste products were not in the spider to begin with.</p>
<h3 id='respiration'>Respiration</h3>
<p>Spiders like L. reclusa use both pores distributed throughout the body (tracheae) and lungs to breathe. Pores directly transfer oxygen to nearby cells, while lungs direct air flow through a linear system.</p>
<h3 id='circulation'>Circulation</h3>
<p>It has a heart with two arteries to carry blood forwards and backwards. The forwards artery branches out and empties blood throughout the spider’s body and into the book lungs, structures with stacked tissue and air pockets designed to optimise air exposure. Blood travels via the pericardial cavity back to the heart.</p>
<h3 id='reproduction'>Reproduction</h3>
<p>A male finds a female via her scent, whether by her web or a surface on which she has moved; the courtship process involves the male moving the threads in the female’s web in a particular fashion; he may dance as well. He will then deposit sperm on a sperm web that he has spun, picking up the sperm and storing it in special cavities in appendanges called pedipalps. These are inserted in the female, who stores sperm in seminal receptacles. Hundreds of eggs may be laid at once in a cocoon.</p>
<h3 id='trivia'>Trivia</h3>
<ul><li>Brown recluses have particularly strong venom, which, among other more typical symptoms, can sometimes kill red blood cells, cause skin cell death, or very occasionally cause red blood cells to burst.</li>
<li>The brown recluse is commonly seen as a household pest; attempts to eradicate it have failed. This is probably because it has proven itself able to survive in both hot and cold temperatures, but more importantly, it can live for months without food.</li>
<li>The brown recluse’s bite has similar symptoms to several other conditions, resulting in several misdiagnoses by even professional doctors. Largely because of the spider’s infamy, many cases of spider bites are reported annually; however, most are eventually diagnosed as symptoms of other diseases.</li>
